    fcut(r, rcut)

Cut-off function whose value smoothly transitions to zero as `r` approaches `rcut`.
Ensures continuity by using a cosine-based smoothing function.

- `rcut_tol`: A tolerance applied to the cut-off radius, can be positive or negative.

# Returns
- A smoothly varying value between 1 and 0, with `fcut(r, rcut) = 0` for `r > rcut`.
