    struct Basis{Orb, Ov, P, R}

A data structure that represents the basis of a system, containing information about orbitals, overlap integrals, parameters, and precomputed radial functions (RLLM).

# Fields
- `orbitals::Orb`: A collection of orbitals for each ion in the system. This typically contains the orbital functions and axes associated with each ion.
- `overlaps::Ov`: A collection of overlap integrals between orbitals. These overlap integrals define how the orbitals interact with each other spatially.
- `parameters::P`: Parameters used for computing the matrix elements between orbitals. These can include interaction strengths, angular momentum values, and other system-specific constants.
- `rllm::R`: Precomputed radial functions (RLLM), typically stored as spline objects for efficient interpolation. These functions depend on the distance between ions and are used in overlap integrals.
